**Patrick Wyatt's GitHub projects**

If you've looked at my [GitHub page](https://github.com/webcoyote) you might be a bit confused by all the projects listed there. What are they and how do they relate to each other?!? I hope this page will explain.

## AI

- [sandvault](https://github.com/webcoyote/sandvault): [Original] [macOS] Run AI agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini) in a sandboxed macOS user account to protect your system from potential AI-generated code risks.

- [clodpod](https://github.com/webcoyote/clodpod): [Original] [macOS] Run AI agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini) sandboxed inside an OSX virtual machine for security and isolation.


## Browser

- [TubeGate](https://github.com/webcoyote/TubeGate): [Original] [Chrome] A Chrome browser extension that removes unwanted videos from your YouTube feed. [Chrome Web Store Listing](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tubegate/aokfpmegeafainbhjfhkgnhlodnndpck)


## iOS

- [habits](https://github.com/webcoyote/habits): [Original] [iOS] Unpublished IOS app to track daily habits and build consistent routines.

- [realitykit](https://github.com/webcoyote/realitykit): [Original] [iOS] Unpublished RealityKit test app for iOS exploring AR and 3D capabilities.


## macOS

- [Phoenix Slides](https://github.com/webcoyote/creevey): [Cloned] [macOS] A Mac application to view pictures; similar to the Windows [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com) app.


## Development Tools

- [git-multi-hook](https://github.com/webcoyote/git-multi-hook): [Original] [All platforms] Enable multiple global and per-repo git hooks while keeping existing hooks working.

- [pbutils](https://github.com/webcoyote/pbutils): [Original] [All platforms] Cross-platform utilities: pbcopy (copy stdin to clipboard), pbpaste (paste clipboard to stdout), tnet (simple telnet).


## System Configuration

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/webcoyote/dotfiles): [Original] [All platforms] Everyone likes to configure their software to their own special needs. This repository contains the settings I use for my projects. This project is referenced by linux-vm to install *my* dotfiles; you can clone it so that you can load *your* changes when you're building virtual machines.


## Windows

- [CSNamedPipes](https://github.com/webcoyote/CSNamedPipes): [Original] [Windows] CSNamedPipes is a demo application that implements interprocess communication (IPC) using Named Pipes in C#. Many programmers had problems handling client-disconnects using Named Pipes, so I wrote this application to (a) learn C# and (b) solve that problem.

- [coho](https://github.com/webcoyote/coho): [Original] [Windows] This library is a basic toolkit for writing C++ programs from scratch on Windows. After having done this many times before I decided to open-source it so I won't have to rewrite again. Sadly most of my recent development has been on Linux and this library has languished.

## Linux Utilities

- [gnome-config-listener](https://github.com/webcoyote/gnome-config-listener): [Original] [Linux] This project is used to build a program that listens for [Gnome desktop](http://www.gnome.org/) configuration changes and writes them to the terminal. I can configure my computer and save all the changes so they can be replayed on other computers.

## Programming Experiments

- [two-queues](https://github.com/webcoyote/two-queues): [Original] [Python/Go] Benchmarking Redis and ZeroMQ pub-sub, using Python and Google's Go language.

## Miscellaneous Code

- [aho_corasick](https://github.com/webcoyote/aho_corasick): [Cloned] [C++] A C++ implementation of the aho corasick pattern search algorithm for efficient string matching.
